			<p><b>My Name is Mathew Lopez, I am a student who is currently enrolled in Millersville University. My major is Applied Engineering, and my focus area is Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD). I am a freshman who graduated from High School at Conestoga Valley Senior High School. I am currently a member of the Millersville Rugby team, and I am working towards my current major so that way I can eventually do something in the field of Architecture.</b></p>

			 <p><b>At Millersville I am a student who lives on campus, as well as a student worker who works at the Upper Deck. It has been a couple of months since I started and overall, it has been a fun experience at Millersville. Currently I have been working for about 15-20 hours a week as well as going to classes and practices for Millersville Rugby. While living on campus I live with my brother in a double suite, and 2 other roommates who are cool people. A lot of the people I have met on campus have been fun to hang out with, and I do not think I would be able to adjust as well as I have without these people in my life. </b></p></td>
